```bash
# Safe binary analysis commands
hexdump -C joe.note | head -50          # Hex dump analysis
od -x joe.note | head -20               # Octal dump
file joe.note                           # File type detection
stat joe.note                           # File size and metadata
```

### 2. COMPARATIVE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

## RESEARCH PROTOCOL: BINARY FORENSICS APPROACH

### PHASE 1: FILE STRUCTURE MAPPING

**1.1 Header Analysis**
```bash
# Identify file signatures and headers
head -c 100 joe.note | hexdump -C
```
**Expected Findings**: Magic bytes, version identifiers, metadata headers

**1.2 Address Pattern Discovery**
```bash
# Search for address patterns like <LAYERBITMAP:XXX>
strings joe.note | grep -E "<LAYER|BITMAP|ADDRESS"
```
**Expected Findings**: Layer metadata tags, bitmap addresses

**1.3 Data Block Identification**
```bash
# Analyze file structure and find bitmap data blocks
od -A x -t x1z joe.note | grep -E "61 |62 |63 |64 |65 |66 |67 |68"
```
**Expected Findings**: RLE color codes and data patterns

### PHASE 2: LAYER STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

**2.1 Multi-Layer Discovery**
- Map all layer references in file
- Identify BGLAYER vs MAINLAYER vs LAYER1-3
- Document address patterns and sizes

**2.2 Bitmap Address Verification**

- Validate length fields at addresses
- Map actual bitmap data locations

**2.3 RLE Pattern Analysis**
- Study color code sequences (0x61-0x68)
- Analyze length encoding patterns
- Document special markers (0xFF, 0x80 bit patterns)

### PHASE 3: ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT

**3.1 Independent RLE Decoder Design**
- Based on binary analysis findings only
- Original algorithms not derived from AGPL code

## LEGAL COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION

### DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
1. **Research Log**: All binary analysis sessions documented
2. **Development History**: Algorithm design decisions recorded
3. **Reference Sources**: Only permitted materials cited
4. **Independence Proof**: No AGPL code access during development

### AUDIT TRAIL
- Git commits with timestamps and clear authorship
- Design decision documentation with reasoning
- Binary analysis output files and interpretations
- Performance improvement metrics and methods

### RISK MITIGATION
- **No quarantined file access**: Absolute prohibition enforced
- **Independent verification**: Third-party legal review
- **Clean room protocols**: Physical/virtual separation maintained
- **Alternative references**: Only Apache/MIT licensed sources

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Technical Targets
- **Pixel Extraction**: 2,600,000+ pixels (commercial threshold)
- **Performance**: <0.5s processing time maintained  
- **Accuracy**: Match device output quality
- **Compatibility**: Handle various .note file versions

### Legal Compliance
- **Zero AGPL dependencies**: Production code completely clean
