# Current Context

## Ongoing Tasks
- Complete comprehensive testing of Ghost Writer system ✅
- Verify all extraction and transcription capabilities ✅  
- Create stable tag for verified working state

## Known Issues
- Main CLI integration needs API credentials
- No clean room web interface exists
- Documentation contained misleading performance claims (cleaned up)

## Next Steps
- Tag repository as baseline-dual-core-verified
- Fix main CLI integration issues
- Consider creating clean room web interface
- Update documentation with accurate performance metrics

## Current Session Summary

VERIFIED WORKING CORES:
1. Web Demo System - Complete end-to-end with Qwen2.5-VL transcription
2. Forensic Extraction - Produces perfectly readable handwriting (95K pixels)
3. Clean Room Implementation - Identical quality to forensic, AGPL-free
4. Local Vision Model - Superior handwriting recognition via Ollama

CRITICAL FINDING: Both extraction approaches produce genuinely readable handwritten text when properly tested with visual verification, not just pixel counts.
