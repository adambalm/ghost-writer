# Decision Log

## Decision 1: Established Verified Working Baseline
- **Date:** 2025-08-25
- **Context:** After comprehensive Playwright testing and visual verification, identified that core extraction and transcription capabilities are genuinely functional. Multiple approaches (sn2md, forensic, clean room) all produce readable handwriting output.
- **Decision:** Create git tag 'baseline-dual-core-verified' as stable rollback point before attempting any integration improvements
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Could have continued without tagging
  - Could have waited for CLI integration fixes  
  - Could have tested more thoroughly first
- **Consequences:** 
  - Provides stable rollback point if future work breaks core functionality
  - Establishes verified baseline for both extraction approaches
  - Enables confident iteration on integration improvements
  - Documents working state with comprehensive test evidence
