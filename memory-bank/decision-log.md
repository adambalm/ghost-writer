# Decision Log

## Decision 1: Hybrid OCR Approach
- **Date:** 2025-08-08
- **Context:** Need for high-accuracy OCR with cost control
- **Decision:** Implement hybrid OCR with multiple providers (Tesseract, Qwen2.5-VL, Google Vision, GPT-4)
- **Alternatives Considered:** Single provider, cloud-only, local-only
- **Consequences:** Better accuracy, higher complexity, predictable costs with budget controls

## Decision 2: Local-First Privacy Design
- **Date:** 2025-08-08
- **Context:** Privacy-conscious users need secure processing
- **Decision:** Default to local processing with optional cloud enhancement
- **Alternatives Considered:** Cloud-first, hybrid-default, local-only
- **Consequences:** Strong privacy guarantee, slightly lower accuracy for local-only mode

## Decision 3: Clean Room Decoder Development
- **Date:** 2025-08-14
- **Context:** sn2md/supernotelib have AGPL licensing issues for commercial use
- **Decision:** Develop independent Supernote decoder without using licensed code
- **Alternatives Considered:** License negotiation, alternative libraries, format abandonment
- **Consequences:** More development effort, full commercial freedom, current performance gap

## Decision 4: MyPy Strict Compliance
- **Date:** 2025-08-25
- **Context:** Need for type safety and code quality
- **Decision:** Achieve 100% MyPy compliance with strict settings
- **Alternatives Considered:** Partial typing, runtime checks only, no typing
- **Consequences:** Better code quality, earlier error detection, some development overhead

## Decision 5: Multi-Strategy Concept Clustering
- **Date:** 2025-08-10
- **Context:** Need to organize scattered ideas from notes
- **Decision:** Use multiple extraction strategies (topics, actions, entities, keywords)
- **Alternatives Considered:** Single strategy, LLM-only, rule-based only
- **Consequences:** Better concept coverage, higher processing time, more complex implementation

## Decision 6: Document-Based Agent Communication
- **Date:** 2025-08-15
- **Context:** Multi-agent development coordination needed
- **Decision:** Use markdown documents for inter-agent communication
- **Alternatives Considered:** API calls, message queue, direct integration
- **Consequences:** Clear audit trail, version control friendly, some manual coordination

## Decision 7: 65% Test Coverage Requirement
- **Date:** 2025-08-20
- **Context:** Balance between quality and development speed
- **Decision:** Set 65% as minimum test coverage requirement
- **Alternatives Considered:** 80% requirement, 50% requirement, no requirement
- **Consequences:** Good quality baseline, reasonable development pace, currently at 76%

## Decision 8: Enterprise Production Pipeline
- **Date:** 2025-08-25
- **Context:** Need for robust CI/CD with quality gates
- **Decision:** Implement comprehensive pipeline with staging and production stages
- **Alternatives Considered:** Simple CI only, manual deployment, basic automation
- **Consequences:** Higher reliability, automated quality checks, deployment complexity
