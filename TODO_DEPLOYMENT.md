# Deployment Implementation TODO

## Overview
The Enterprise Production Pipeline workflow includes placeholder scripts that need real implementation once deployment target is determined.

## Missing Implementation

### 1. Deployment Target Detection
**Status**: Not configured
**Priority**: High

Determine deployment platform:
- [ ] Render.com - Simple web service deployment
- [ ] Heroku - Platform-as-a-Service 
- [ ] Kubernetes - Container orchestration
- [ ] AWS ECS/Fargate - Container service
- [ ] Docker Swarm - Container orchestration
- [ ] Custom VPS/server deployment

### 2. Staging Smoke Tests (`scripts/staging_smoke_tests.py`)
**Status**: Placeholder implementation
**Priority**: Medium

Implement actual tests:
- [ ] Health endpoint verification
- [ ] API authentication tests
- [ ] Core OCR functionality tests
- [ ] Database connectivity verification
- [ ] End-to-end workflow validation
- [ ] Response time benchmarks

### 3. Production Health Checks (`scripts/production_health_check.py`)
**Status**: Placeholder implementation  
**Priority**: High

Implement monitoring:
- [ ] Application health endpoints
- [ ] Resource utilization monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
- [ ] Database connection pool status
- [ ] OCR provider availability checks
- [ ] Queue depth monitoring
- [ ] Error rate tracking
- [ ] Response time analysis

### 4. Rollback Mechanism (`scripts/rollback_deployment.py`)
**Status**: Placeholder implementation
**Priority**: Critical

Platform-specific rollback:
- [ ] **Render**: API-based rollback to previous deployment
- [ ] **Heroku**: Release rollback via Heroku API
- [ ] **Kubernetes**: `kubectl rollout undo` implementation
- [ ] **Docker**: Container version rollback
- [ ] Database migration rollback strategy
- [ ] Configuration rollback procedures

### 5. Actual Deployment Logic
**Status**: Placeholder comments in workflow
**Priority**: High

Implement deployment steps:
- [ ] Container build and push
- [ ] Environment configuration
- [ ] Database migrations
- [ ] Blue-green deployment strategy
- [ ] Traffic switching mechanism
- [ ] Deployment verification

## Implementation Steps

1. **Choose deployment target** based on requirements:
   - Cost considerations
   - Scaling requirements  
   - Maintenance overhead
   - Feature requirements

2. **Implement deployment scripts** for chosen target

3. **Add comprehensive tests** for all deployment components

4. **Set up monitoring and alerting** for production environment

5. **Document deployment procedures** and runbooks

## Testing Requirements

All deployment scripts should include:
- [ ] Unit tests with mocked external dependencies
- [ ] Integration tests with staging environment
- [ ] Failure scenario testing
- [ ] Rollback procedure testing
- [ ] Performance impact assessment

## Security Considerations

- [ ] Secure credential management
- [ ] Network security configuration
- [ ] Access control and authentication
- [ ] Audit logging for deployment actions
- [ ] Compliance with security standards
