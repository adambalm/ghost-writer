# DEVELOPMENT LOG

This file tracks development context and coordination between different development sessions.
It ensures continuity of work across sessions and context switches.

## Purpose
- Maintain state awareness between development sessions
- Provide clear entry points for resuming work
- Capture decisions, rationale, and current tasks

## Current Active Branch
