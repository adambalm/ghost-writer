### [2025-08-08T00:00:00Z] Development Session - Task Assignment
**Type**: Task Assignment
**Priority**: Standard  

**Context Transfer**:
- Baseline: 78/81 tests passing (96.3% success rate)
- Failed tests: 3 E2E integration tests with API dependencies
- System architecture: 6k+ lines across OCR, NLP, structure components

**Task Focus**:
```yaml
objective: Fix failing E2E integration tests
criteria:
  - All 3 failing E2E tests should pass
  - Test coverage maintained at baseline level
  - No regression in passing tests
  - Proper mock implementation for API dependencies

failing_tests:
  - test_dual_beachhead_premium_accuracy_pipeline
  - test_idea_organization_beachhead_pipeline  
  - test_large_document_processing

issues_identified:
  - Missing OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
  - Google Vision client initialization issues
  - HybridOCR.__init__() parameter mismatch
  - Mock behavior vs. test expectations misalignment
```

**Resources Provided**:
- Full codebase access: /home/ed/ghost-writer/
- Test suite: /home/ed/ghost-writer/tests/
- Existing fixtures: OCR mocks, database mocks, test data generators
- Configuration: /home/ed/ghost-writer/config/config.yaml

**Documentation Protocol**:
- Update status tracking in project files
- Log solutions in development artifacts
- Create test result dashboard
- Document completion status

**Success Criteria**:
- pytest reports 81/81 tests passing
- All E2E integration tests executing with proper mocks
- No API key dependencies in test execution
- Test execution time maintained <120s

### [2025-08-08T06:20:00Z] Development Session - Task Completion
