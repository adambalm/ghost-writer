- ✅ Updated test badge: 137 passed (was 132 passed, 8 failed)
- ✅ Updated coverage badge: 76% (was 79%)
- ✅ Fixed test counts throughout document
- ✅ Updated test suite execution time: ~101s (was ~113s)
- ✅ Corrected quality metrics section

#### CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Updated test coverage: 76% (was 70%+)
- ✅ Added MyPy compliance status: 100% (0 errors)
- ✅ Updated CI/CD status to Enterprise Production Pipeline
- ✅ Added note about Qwen2.5-VL integration

#### QUICK_START.md
- ✅ Fixed script paths to match actual files
- ✅ Updated web viewer to enhanced_web_viewer.py
- ✅ Changed port reference to 5001
- ✅ Fixed .venv path consistency

#### USAGE_GUIDE.md
- ✅ Updated web interface port to 5001
- ✅ Fixed launcher script name
- ✅ Updated project structure diagram
- ✅ Removed references to non-existent scripts

### 3. Documentation Archived
Moved outdated documentation to archive:
- **docs/EVIDENCE.md** → **docs/archive/EVIDENCE.md** (Black flag recovery notes)
- **docs/PROJECT_MAP.md** → **docs/archive/PROJECT_MAP.md** (Contains outdated deployment info)

### 4. Key Issues Identified

#### Licensing Risk
- **sn2md/supernotelib**: AGPL licensed, incompatible with commercial use
- Clean room decoder implemented but needs enhancement
- Current performance gap: 0 strokes vs 2.8M pixels

#### Documentation Gaps
- Some scripts referenced in docs don't exist
- Web interface documentation mixed between old and new versions
- Deployment scripts are placeholders

## Current Project Status

### Testing & Quality
- **Tests**: 137 passing (100% success rate)
- **Coverage**: 76.38% (exceeds 65% requirement)
- **MyPy**: Full compliance (0 errors)
- **Ruff**: All checks passing
- **CI/CD**: Enterprise Production Pipeline configured

### Technical Stack
- **OCR**: Hybrid approach with Tesseract, Qwen2.5-VL, Google Vision, GPT-4
- **Processing**: Relationship detection, concept clustering, structure generation
- **Database**: SQLite with privacy-first design
- **Web**: Flask interface on port 5001

### Known Issues
1. Clean room decoder extracts 0 strokes (needs enhancement)
2. Deployment scripts are placeholders
3. Some documentation references archived files

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Enhance clean room decoder to match sn2md performance
2. Implement actual deployment scripts
3. Remove all sn2md/supernotelib dependencies

### Medium Priority
1. Create migration guide from sn2md to clean room decoder
2. Document current limitations clearly
3. Update all script references in documentation

### Low Priority
1. Reorganize documentation structure
2. Add more architectural diagrams
3. Create video tutorials

## Files Modified
- 5 Memory Bank files updated
- 4 main documentation files updated
- 2 documentation files archived
- 1 new report created (this file)

## Verification
All changes have been verified through:
- Running test suite: 137 tests passing
- Checking file paths and references
- Validating metrics against actual test output
- Cross-referencing with codebase structure
