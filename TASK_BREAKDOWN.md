# TASK BREAKDOWN - Multi-Agent System Deployment

**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Phase**: 1→2 Transition  
**Supervisor**: Claude 4 Sonnet  
**Date**: 2025-08-08  

## Current System State

**Baseline Performance**:
- Single-agent tests: 78/81 passed (96.3% success rate)
- Failed tests: 3 E2E integration tests (API dependencies)
- Core components: All unit tests passing ✅
- Test coverage: >95% on core functionality

**Architecture Status**:
- 6k+ lines of code across OCR, NLP, structure generation
- Database layer: Fully functional with SQLite
- OCR providers: HybridOCR with fallback mechanisms  
- Testing framework: Comprehensive pytest suite with fixtures

## Agent Deployment Plan

### 1. QA Agent Deployment
**Responsibility**: Cross-component testing, integration validation
**Model**: Gemini 2.5 Pro ($2.50/$15) - Cost-optimized testing specialist
**Tasks**:
- Fix failing E2E integration tests
- Maintain test coverage ≥95%
- Create integration test frameworks
- Validate agent handoffs

### 2. Implementation Agent Deployment  
**Responsibility**: Coding, feature development, component tests
**Model**: Claude 4 Sonnet ($3/$15) - Code generation specialist
**Tasks**:
- Component development and maintenance
- Unit test creation and updates
- Code review and optimization
- Feature implementation

### 3. Coordination Protocol Setup
**Document-Based Handoffs**:
- AGENT_STATUS.md: Current agent states and tasks
- HANDOFF_ARTIFACTS.md: Inter-agent communication log
- PERFORMANCE_METRICS.md: Cost and efficiency tracking
- QUALITY_DASHBOARD.md: Test results and coverage

## Success Criteria

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] All agents deployed and functional
- [ ] Test coverage maintained ≥95% of baseline
- [ ] Communication overhead <35s per coordination cycle  
- [ ] Failed tests reduced from 3 to ≤1

**Cost Optimization**:
- [ ] Daily cost tracking established
- [ ] Target: <$15/day total system cost
- [ ] Model assignment validated for cost-effectiveness

**Quality Assurance**:
- [ ] Document-based handoff protocols working
- [ ] Agent coordination artifacts created
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard active
- [ ] Fallback to single-agent capability preserved

## Risk Mitigation

**Agent Coordination Failures**:
- Immediate fallback to Supervisor-only mode
- All agent outputs logged for audit
- Human intervention triggers at performance degradation

**Cost Overruns**:
- Hard stop at $25/day
- Real-time cost monitoring per agent
- Model reassignment if efficiency targets missed

**Quality Degradation**:
- Test suite must maintain baseline performance
- Agent confidence scoring for task assignment
- Automatic escalation on failure rate >15%

---

**Next Action**: Deploy QA Agent to address E2E integration test failures
**Handoff Protocol**: Document-based artifacts for all coordination
**Monitoring**: Cost and performance tracking initiated
