# TASK BREAKDOWN - Development Planning

**Status**: In Progress
**Phase**: Development Phase 2
**Date**: 2025-08-08  

## Current System State

**Baseline Performance**:
- Single-agent tests: 78/81 passed (96.3% success rate)
- Failed tests: 3 E2E integration tests (API dependencies)
- Core components: All unit tests passing âœ…
- Test coverage: >95% on core functionality

**Architecture Status**:
- 6k+ lines of code across OCR, NLP, structure generation
- Database layer: Fully functional with SQLite
- OCR providers: HybridOCR with fallback mechanisms  
- Testing framework: Comprehensive pytest suite with fixtures

## Development Plan

### 1. Quality Assurance Focus
**Responsibility**: Cross-component testing, integration validation
**Tasks**:
- Fix failing E2E integration tests
- Maintain test coverage at baseline level
- Create integration test frameworks
- Validate system handoffs

### 2. Implementation Development
**Responsibility**: Coding, feature development, component tests
**Tasks**:
- Component development and maintenance
- Unit test creation and updates
- Code review and optimization
- Feature implementation

### 3. Documentation Protocol
**Document-Based Tracking**:
- AGENT_STATUS.md: Current development status and tasks
- HANDOFF_ARTIFACTS.md: Development coordination log
- PERFORMANCE_METRICS.md: Performance and efficiency tracking
- QUALITY_DASHBOARD.md: Test results and coverage

## Success Criteria

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Development workflow established and functional
- [ ] Test coverage maintained at baseline level
- [ ] Development coordination efficient
- [ ] Failed tests reduced from 3 to 1 or fewer

**Quality Assurance**:
- [ ] Document-based development protocols working
- [ ] Development coordination artifacts maintained
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard active
- [ ] Fallback development capability preserved

## Risk Mitigation

**Development Coordination Issues**:
- Fallback to simplified development mode
- All development outputs logged for review
- Intervention triggers at performance degradation

**Quality Degradation**:
- Test suite must maintain baseline performance
- Development confidence tracking for task assignment
- Escalation on failure rate >15%

**Next Action**: Address E2E integration test failures
**Development Protocol**: Document-based artifacts for coordination
**Monitoring**: Performance tracking initiated
